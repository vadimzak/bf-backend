## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Setup Complexity and Initial Configuration

**NX:**
```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest myworkspace
# Interactive setup with presets for different frameworks
# Generates comprehensive folder structure and configuration
```
- Pros: Guided setup, framework-specific presets, comprehensive tooling
- Cons: Can be overwhelming for simple use cases, opinionated structure

**Turborepo:**
```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
# Minimal setup with basic monorepo structure
# Simple turbo.json configuration
```
- Pros: Quick to get started, minimal configuration, clear defaults
- Cons: May need additional setup for complex workflows

**Lerna + Yarn Workspaces:**
```bash
npm install -g lerna
lerna init
# Manual package.json workspace configuration
# Individual package setup required
```
- Pros: Full control over configuration, familiar npm/yarn patterns
- Cons: Requires significant manual setup, easy to misconfigure

### 2. Build Performance and Caching

**NX:**
- Computation caching based on file content hashes
- Distributed caching across team members
- Intelligent task orchestration and dependency management
- Performance: ðŸŸ¢ Excellent

**Turborepo:**
- Fast incremental builds with content-aware hashing
- Remote caching integration (especially with Vercel)
- Pipeline parallelization and task dependencies
- Performance: ðŸŸ¢ Excellent

**Lerna + Yarn Workspaces:**

- Prevents version conflicts automatically

**Turborepo:**
```json
{
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"],
  "dependencies": {
    "shared-lib": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```
