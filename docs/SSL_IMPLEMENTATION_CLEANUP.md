# SSL Implementation Cleanup Summary

## What Was Kept (In Production Use)

### AWS Resources:
1. **Secondary Private IP**: 172.20.245.38
   - Associated with network interface eni-098604c52f9eaec90
   - Persistent via netplan configuration

2. **Elastic IP**: 51.84.199.169 (eipalloc-0906614816b28d4bf)
   - Associated with secondary private IP
   - Used for all application traffic

3. **Security Group Rules**:
   - Port 80 (HTTP)
   - Port 8404 (HAProxy stats)
   - Port 30443 (HTTPS NodePort)

### Server Configuration:
1. **HAProxy** (`/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`)
   - Binds to secondary IP for ports 80/443
   - Forwards to NodePorts 30080/30443

2. **kube-api-forward.service**
   - systemd service using socat
   - Forwards primary-ip:443 → localhost:8443

3. **Netplan Configuration** (`/etc/netplan/99-secondary-ip.yaml`)
   - Makes secondary IP persistent across reboots

### Scripts:
1. `update-app-dns-secondary.sh` - Updates DNS to secondary IP
2. All other k8s scripts for general cluster management

### Documentation:
1. `K8S_PORT_ISSUE.md` - Original problem description
2. `K8S_STANDARD_PORTS_SETUP.md` - Current implementation
3. `K8S_HTTPS_PORT_443_SOLUTIONS.md` - Comprehensive analysis

## What Was Cleaned Up

### Scripts Removed:
1. `setup-haproxy-http.sh` - Duplicate of setup-haproxy.sh
2. `setup-haproxy-advanced.sh` - Failed SNI routing attempt

### Server Files Removed:
1. `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.manifest.corrupted`
2. `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.manifest.backup-secondary-ip`

### Temporary Files Removed:
1. `/tmp/haproxy-*.cfg` - Various test configurations
2. `/tmp/control-plane-*.yaml` - Test manifests
3. `/tmp/current-api-manifest.yaml`
4. `/tmp/letsencrypt-issuer.yaml`

## Final State

### Architecture:
```
Primary IP (51.16.46.89):
  - Port 443 → socat → localhost:8443 (API Server)
  - kubectl access works normally

Secondary IP (51.84.199.169):
  - Port 80 → HAProxy → localhost:30080 (HTTP apps)
  - Port 443 → HAProxy → localhost:30443 (HTTPS apps)
  - All application traffic

DNS Configuration:
  - api.k8s.vadimzak.com → 51.16.46.89 (primary)
  - *.vadimzak.com → 51.84.199.169 (secondary)
  - sample*.vadimzak.com → 51.84.199.169 (secondary)
```

### Cost Impact:
- Additional Elastic IP: ~$3.60/month
- No other additional costs

### Maintenance Notes:
1. Secondary IP is persistent via netplan
2. socat service auto-starts on boot
3. HAProxy configured to use secondary IP
4. All changes are scripted for reproducibility

## Lessons for Future:
1. Document attempts as you go (we did this well)
2. Clean up failed attempts promptly
3. Use git branches for experimental changes
4. Keep backup files minimal and labeled clearly
